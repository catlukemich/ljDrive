	 * How the resize system works: First, you need to add a WWT_RESIZEBOX to the
	 * widgets, and you need to add the flag WDF_RESIZABLE to the window. Now the
	 * window is ready to resize itself. As you may have noticed, all widgets have a
	 * RESIZE_XX in their line. This lines controls how the widgets behave on
	 * resize. RESIZE_NONE means it doesn't do anything. Any other option let's one
	 * of the borders move with the changed width/height. So if a widget has
	 * RESIZE_RIGHT, and the window is made 5 pixels wider by the user, the right of
	 * the window will also be made 5 pixels wider. Now, what if you want to clamp a
	 * widget to the bottom? Give it the flag RESIZE_TB. This is RESIZE_TOP +
	 * RESIZE_BOTTOM. Now if the window gets 5 pixels bigger, both the top and
	 * bottom gets 5 bigger, so the whole widgets moves downwards without resizing,
	 * and appears to be clamped to the bottom. Nice aint it? You should know one
	 * more thing about this system. Most windows can't handle an increase of 1
	 * pixel. So there is a step function, which let the windowsize only be changed
	 * by X pixels. You configure this after making the window, like this:
	 * w.resize.step_height = 10; Now the window will only change in height in steps
	 * of 10. You can also give a minimum width and height. The default value is the
	 * default height/width of the window itself. You can change this AFTER
	 * window-creation, with: w.resize.width or w.resize.height. That was all.. good
	 * luck, and enjoy :) -- TrueLight
